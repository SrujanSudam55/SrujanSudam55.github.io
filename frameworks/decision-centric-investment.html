  <h2>Decision-Centric Investment Framework</h2>

  <p>
    Most investment conversations drift into tools, use cases, and capability shopping.
    This framework forces a different order: decision first, ownership second, then support, then durability.

      <h3>1) Decision criticality</h3>
      <p class="small">
        If you cannot name the decision, you are not investing yet. You are browsing.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><span class="v">Which decision are we improving, in plain language?</span></li>
        <li><span class="v">What changes if it improves (cost, risk, growth, customer outcome)?</span></li>
        <li><span class="v">How often does this decision recur, and at what scale?</span></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <p class="small muted">
        Example: FS credit policy exceptions. TMT content escalation decisions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="fx-mini">
      <h3>2) Decision ownership</h3>
      <p class="small">
        Ownership is not who sponsored the pilot. Ownership is who is accountable when outcomes disappoint.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><span class="v">Who owns the decision on a bad day?</span></li>
        <li><span class="v">What is the challenge line for borderline cases?</span></li>
        <li><span class="v">Who has authority to override, and who audits overrides?</span></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <p class="small muted">
        This is the step most AI programs skip, then pay for later.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="fx-mini">
      <h3>3) Decision supportability</h3>
      <p class="small">
        Not every decision benefits from automation. Choose the smallest support that changes the outcome.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><span class="v"><span class="k">Information</span> for visibility (dashboards, alerts).</span></li>
        <li><span class="v"><span class="k">Recommendation</span> for prioritisation (ranking, scoring).</span></li>
        <li><span class="v"><span class="k">Automation</span> only when reversibility and risk are controlled.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <p class="small muted">
        If the decision is political or ambiguous, start with recommendation, not automation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="fx-mini">
      <h3>4) Decision durability</h3>
      <p class="small">
        A win that collapses at scale is not a win. Durability is the strategy.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><span class="v">What happens under volume spikes or stress events?</span></li>
        <li><span class="v">What incentives will people optimise around?</span></li>
        <li><span class="v">What regulatory or audit expectations apply?</span></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <p class="small muted">
        Durable systems treat edge cases as first-order design inputs.
      </p>
    </div>

  <h2>Common failure modes</h2>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>
      <span class="k">Tool-first investment</span>
      <span class="v">You buy capability before you own the decision, then retrofit value later.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="k">Use case sprawl</span>
      <span class="v">Teams run pilots in parallel, but leadership cannot steer because no decision spine exists.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="k">Feasibility mistaken for value</span>
      <span class="v">A model works, so it ships. Outcomes do not improve because the decision was never defined.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="k">Ownership dissolves after the pilot</span>
      <span class="v">When edge cases appear, responsibility becomes conditional and escalations return.</span>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Use it in 10 minutes</h2>
  <p class="small">
    Pick one decision. Run the sequence. If you get stuck at Step 2, stop.
    That is the work.
