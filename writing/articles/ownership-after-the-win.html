  <h2>Ownership after the win</h2>

  <p>
    I have seen the same pattern play out in AI discussions more times than I can count.
  </p>

  <p>
    The meeting starts with ambition.
    It ends with a list.
  </p>

  <ul class="list">
    <li><span class="v">Tools to evaluate</span></li>
    <li><span class="v">Use cases to explore</span></li>
    <li><span class="v">Processes to automate</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Somewhere along the way, the real question gets lost.
  </p>

  <h2>Lists feel productive. Decisions feel expensive.</h2>
  <p>
    Lists are attractive because they are non-committal.
    They create the feeling of progress without forcing a choice.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can add to a list without removing anything.
    You can agree with a list without owning the consequences.
    You can leave a meeting aligned without being accountable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Decisions do the opposite.
    They collapse options. They create losers. They introduce irreversibility.
  </p>

  <h2>Why AI conversations stall</h2>
  <p>
    When AI discussions stay at the level of tools and possibilities, they feel busy but unsatisfying.
    Not because the ideas are bad.
    But because the conversation never quite reaches the level leaders actually operate at.
  </p>

  <p>
    Leaders are paid to make choices under uncertainty.
    To accept trade-offs.
    To live with outcomes that cannot be reframed away later.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI initiatives stall when they never cross that threshold.
    They move forward operationally, but not strategically.
  </p>

  <h2>The missing step after momentum</h2>
  <p>
    Many teams mistake early momentum for progress.
  </p>

  <p>
    A pilot runs.
    A dashboard lights up.
    A model produces sensible-looking outputs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then comes the quiet question no one wants to answer:
    <em>Who owns this when it produces an uncomfortable result?</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Ownership after the win is harder than ownership before it.
    Before success, uncertainty protects everyone.
    After success, responsibility becomes visible.
  </p>

  <h2>Why starting with use cases fragments effort</h2>
  <p>
    Starting with AI use cases often feels practical.
    In reality, it fragments attention.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each use case carries its own assumptions, incentives, and failure modes.
    Without a unifying decision, teams optimise locally and drift globally.
  </p>

  <p>
    The organisation accumulates activity, not direction.
    And leadership is left reviewing progress without being able to steer it.
  </p>

  <h2>What works instead</h2>
  <p>
    The pattern that holds up is simpler, but stricter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Start by naming the decision.
    Make the trade-offs explicit.
    Assign ownership that remains true when the system is wrong, not only when it is right.
  </p>

  <p>
    Only then ask where analytics or AI can safely carry weight.
  </p>

  <h2>Closing</h2>
  <p>
    AI initiatives do not fail because teams lack ideas.
    They fail because responsibility dissolves after the initial win.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the decision is not owned, no amount of tooling will save it.
    Momentum without ownership is just motion.
